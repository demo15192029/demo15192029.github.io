For the most part, these characters will be presented in a God&#39;s-eye view, but 
these models will also be used for close-ups of the cards and CG video. Btw, To 
ensure better picture quality, we will render each action as a sequence of 
frames separately.<br>
<br>
Please make the lines as round and full as possible and avoid angles. The left 
and right parts should be perfectly symmetrical. keep the light source in the 
same position from character to character, with the light source from the top 
down, bottom with a natural shadow. This ensures that the light source remains 
constant when the character is flipped from side to side.<br>
<br>
These model needs to ensure that we can successfully perform the common actions 
in the reference video, and we will create actions for the characters to Moving, 
Flying, Fighting, Skill, Resting, Injured, Dying in the game. please take care of the
