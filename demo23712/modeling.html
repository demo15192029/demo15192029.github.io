<b>Modeling Requirements</b><br>
<br>
For the most part, these characters will be presented in a God&#39;s-eye view, but 
these models will also be used for close-ups of the cards and CG video. Btw, To 
ensure better picture quality, we will render each action as a sequence of 
frames separately.<br>
<br>
Please make the lines as round and full as possible and avoid angles. Try to use 
simple lines. The simpler the line structure, the better. The left 
and right parts should be perfectly symmetrical. keep the light source in the 
same position from character to character, with the light source from the top 
down, bottom with a natural shadow. This ensures that the light source remains 
constant when the character is flipped from side to side.<br>
<img border="0" src="eyes.jpg" width="500" height="320"><br>
Our characters normally have pupils that are 20-25% of the size of the eyeball. 
Individual characters may be 15-35%, depending on the actual effect.<br>
<br>
These model needs to ensure that we can successfully perform the common actions 
in the reference video, and we will create actions for the characters to Moving, 
Flying, Fighting, Skill, Resting, Injured, Dying in the game. please take care of the 
<font color="#FF9933">DETAILS</font>

the list of game productions.<br>

animals, and we need to get closer to the normal body proportions of real 
animals. cartoons is about 40%, Real Animals is about 60%.<br>

orbs with pure black pupils that look like black dots.<br>
