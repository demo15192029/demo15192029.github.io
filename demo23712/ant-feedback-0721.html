<b>Ant FeedBack 0721</b></p>
<p align="left">Thank you for your work, I share with you our feedback, I&#39;m 
sorry if I didn&#39;t express myself very well...<br>
1.The antenna curve looks good. but don&#39;t need to add a tube underneath the 
antenna. please refer to the design drawing for the antenna&#39;s folding point.<br>
<br>
2.The ends of the 6 legs are not completely faceted, but have a slight curves. 
all legs should be close to the stick structure of the picture, don&#39;t need to 
flattening.<br>
<br>
3.There is something wrong with the position of the joints in the leg movements, 
The arm joints of ants are very strange and the joints should be in a folded 
position. otherwise, you should have thought of that I think. it will not be 
rigging correctly.<br>
For the rig, here is a link for reference:<br>
https://fiverr-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/secured-attachments/messaging_message/attachment/082abe015b706d78611138ba599db92f-1689951535592/Front%20%2813%29.png?__cld_token__=exp=1690033676~hmac=1bc521ff2651e9fc0351425e1a673fa8bef499efa9dffcc3075527ca50471c00<br>
<br>
4.The mouth should not have a concave curve, it is a natural rounded &quot;airplane 
head&quot; you can refer to the head in ants and dinosaurs. the teeth should also be 
rounded, not square like. ant&#39;s stomach doesn&#39;t need 3 depressions. <br>
<br>
The character design drawing of the ant is labeled 99%. It&#39;s the drawing of our 
design. I would suggest comparing the design picture with the model. The 
proportion of each structure of the ant&#39;s body should be exactly according to 
the reference drawing above, the current proportion is wrong, this will result 
in a character that is not at all as designed. for example, the proportion 
between the eyeballs and the head(Its eyes should protrude very large.), the 
proportion between the middle-body(is too big) and the head, are all very 
different.<br>
there are a few other details for you to compare.<br>
<br>
Please read the <a href="characters.html">requirements description</a> at the 
top of page first, and please change all angles to absolutely rounded corners, 
No corners, make sure all parts are rounded in style, that&#39;s our style and it&#39;s 
the main character sir.</p>
