MOBA 3 vs 3 Real-time Strategy Multiplayer Game, Unity Engine + 
Photon<br><br>Description:<br><br>We are developing a multiplayer game that combines elements of MOBA (Multiplayer 
Online Battle Arena) and real-time strategy. The game will feature a 3 vs 3 
battle mode where players can engage in strategic battles in real-time. The 
overall game style is somewhat similar to &quot;Clash Royale.&quot;<br><br>Game Features:<br>
<br>Resource Raiding: Players will have the ability to raid the resources of offline 
opponents using limited characters.<br>PvP Battles: Players can challenge each other to battles and compete in 
multiplayer matches.<br>Card Collection: Players can acquire more character cards by drawing cards or 
completing specific missions.<br>Character Progression: Characters can be strengthened and upgraded using items 
obtained in the game.<br>Free-to-play with In-App Purchases: The game will be free to download and play, 
and the primary revenue model will be through in-app purchases of virtual card 
packs. These purchases will not affect game balance, ensuring fair competition 
for all players.<br><br>Gameplay:<br><br>Real-time Strategy: Battles will have simple rules, and the goal is to destroy 
the opponent&#39;s fortress within a time limit, usually 10 minutes, to win and earn 
records and level up.<br>Matchmaking: Players will be matched with opponents of similar levels for fair 
and balanced gameplay.<br><br>Content:<br><br>Initial Release: The game will be played from God&#39;s point of view, and the map 
will be the size of the entire screen.The first version will include one map and 42 characters, each 
with unique abilities. New maps and characters will be added in future updates. 
We will create actions for the characters to Moving, Flying, Fighting, Skill, 
Resting, Injured, Dying in the game.<br>Character Modeling: We will provide all the necessary character assets, 
including 3D models, animations, sound effects, and music.<br><br>Collaboration:<br>
<br>We are currently working on character modeling and sound effects for the game. 
We would like to establish a collaboration with you at this stage to incorporate 
your expertise in Unity3D game development and Photon network integration.<br>&nbsp;please take care of the DETAILS
and we need you to use your imagination.</font> Please do your best. we want to make a beautiful work and include your name in 
the list of game productions.<br>&nbsp;</p>
